You make me wanna run it all back
Nobody’s ever done me like that
I thought I’d never ever need you
Now all I wanna do is see you
I shouldn’t let it happen so fast
Girl, why’d you have to break me like that?
Your love is nothing but a see-through
I tell myself that I should leave you
But who? I don’t wanna know
Where you wanna go
Who you’re taking home
‘Cause I can’t lose everything I know
I hate sleeping alone
I’m picking up the phone
And I’ll be on the way in the middle of the night
‘Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We’re kissing in the car underneath of the light
You got me, you got me
And I’ll be on the way in the middle of the night
There’s something in the way you been running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You got me, you got me
Remember all the nights like this?
Sleeping in the Motel Six
We’d take all of the backstreets home
Making sure your friends don’t know
I never thought I’d get it like this
Still think about the very first kiss
But I could never lie to you
I’m going out my mind for you
But who? I don’t wanna know
Where you wanna go
Who you’re taking home
‘Cause I can’t lose everything I know
I hate sleeping alone
I’m picking up the phone
And I’ll be on the way in the middle of night
‘Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We’re kissing in the car underneath of the light
You got me, you got me
And I’ll be on the way in the middle of the night
There’s something in they way you be running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You got me, you got me
And I’ll be on the way in the middle of the night
‘Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We’re kissing in the car underneath of the light
You got me, you got me
And I’ll be on the way in the middle of the night
There’s something in the way you be running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You got me, you got me
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
Go back to our own ways in the middle of the night
